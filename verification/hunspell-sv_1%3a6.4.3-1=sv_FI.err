Nuspell warning: bytes above 127 in flags in UTF-8 file are treated as lone bytes for backward compatibility. That means if in the flags you have ONE character above ASCII, it may be interpreted as 2, 3, or 4 flags. Please update dictionary and affix files to use FLAG UTF-8 and make the file valid UTF-8 if it is not already. Warning in line 15
